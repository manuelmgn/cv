ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Manuel! I'm starting my career as a web developer. I have dedicated the last years to research in Humanities and I have worked in universities such as Universidade de Santiago de Compostela or Universidad Complutense de Madrid. I recently made the leap into the world of computing, which I have been passionate about since I was a kid.

If you want to know about me, check my social networks or my full CV.
